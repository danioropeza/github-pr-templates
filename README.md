# GitHub Pull Requests Templates

One of the most critical roles we play as developers is to clearly communicate with our team.

As a developer, I want the team members who will review my code to understand what I'm trying to achieve with my work. And as a code reviewer, I want those who propose code changes to explain their changes and let me know how I can test their code.

GitHub allows us to create Pull Request Templates. This feature is very helpful because we can communicate all of our ideas in one place. We can encourage contributors to communicate more effectively with their teams by noting whatâ€™s new and changed.

Also, using pull request templates is a way of educating developers because with the information we remember the developers to do some verifications before creating the pull requests.

### What does this repository have?

This repository contains generic templates for different types of code changes. Likewise, it shows in action the configuration and use of multiple pull request templates through a proposal that has a template creator as a base. This template creator works by copying and pasting some values in the GitHub URL.
