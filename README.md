# Educate developers through GitHub Pull Requests Templates

One of the most critical roles we play as developers is to clearly communicate with our team.

As a developer, I want the team members who will review my code to understand what I'm trying to achieve with my work. And as a code reviewer, I want the developer to explain their changes and let me know how I can test their code.

GitHub allows us to create [Pull Request Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository). This feature is very helpful because we can communicate all of our ideas in one place. We can encourage contributors to communicate more effectively with their teams by noting whatâ€™s new and changed.

Also, using pull request templates is a way of educating developers because with the information we remember the developers to do some verifications before creating the pull requests.
