# GitHub Pull Requests Templates

One of the most critical roles we play as developers is to clearly communicate with our team. When a change or addition is proposed to a codebase as a developer, I want the team members who review the code to understand what I was trying to achieve with that work. As a code reviewer, I want those who propose code changes to explain their changes and let me know me how to test the code.

These templates are boilerqwewqewqeeqeqwqewplate text or other content that will automatically show up in the change request form when project collaborators issue a pull request or a merge request against a code repository.

Communicate better with Templates
By creating templates for pull and merge requests, we can help encourage contributors to communicate more effectively with their teams by noting whatâ€™s new or changed, give testing instructions to reviewers, or even help to ensure that code changes have been thoroughly vetted.

Educate Dev though PRs
